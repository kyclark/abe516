Here are some loose guidelines the project 1:

a)	Where did you obtain the data? The main purpose of the experiment?
b)	 Type of microarray technology? What samples are applied? Specific condition, mutation or treatments? Biological replicates etc.
c)	Brief explanation of the steps/pipeline you used for data preprocessing 
d)	Detect differentially expressed genes
e)	Visualize the top genes? (optional)
f)	Cluster/classification analysis on the samples using significant genes?
g)	Conclusion: interpret your result and its implications.

The report format should be 1.5-line spaced and no more than 5 pages (figures, tables, R
code, and references included).
